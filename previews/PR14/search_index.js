Here, we ignore contributions from Photosystem I and just use a fixed shape as input at the chloroplast level for Photosystem II, hence all spectral shapes are determined by the light distribution within the leaf. Several effects can be observed in the plots below: The first SIF peak at 680nm is much weaker in the forward direction than in the backward direction as more the re-absorption within the leaf is much higher for the forward direction. Similarly, blue incident light penetrates the leaf less than at higher wavelengths, so the chlorophyll re-absorption (backwards) is less re-absorbed by chlorophyll as it emanates from less deep layers.","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Plot Mb matrix\ncontourf(wle, wlf, leaf.Mb)\nxlabel!(\"Excitation wavelength (nm)\")\nylabel!(\"Emission wavelength (nm)\")\ntitle!(\"Fluorescence backward (refl) emission (Mb)\")","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Plot Mf matrix\ncontourf(wle, wlf, leaf.Mf)\nxlabel!(\"Excitation wavelength (nm)\")\nylabel!(\"Emission wavelength (nm)\")\ntitle!(\"Fluorescence forward (transmission) emission (Mf)\")","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Define a few wavelengths:\nwl_blue = 450.0;\nwl_red = 600.0;\nwl_FarRed = 740.0;\nwl_Red = 685.0;\nind_wle_blue  = argmin(abs.(wle .-wl_blue));\nind_wle_red = argmin(abs.(wle .-wl_red));\nind_wlf_FR  = argmin(abs.(wlf .-wl_FarRed));\nind_wlf_R  = argmin(abs.(wlf .-wl_Red));\nind_red = argmin(abs.(wl .-wl_Red));\nind_NIR = argmin(abs.(wl .-800));\nnothing #hide","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Plot some cross section in wle and wlf space:\nplot(wlf,leaf.Mf[:,ind_wle_blue], color=[:black], lw = 2 , label=\"Forward SIF, excited at $wl_blue nm\")\nplot!(wlf,leaf.Mb[:,ind_wle_blue],color=[:orange], lw = 2 , label=\"Backward SIF, excited at $wl_blue nm\" )\nplot!(wlf,leaf.Mf[:,ind_wle_red], color=[:black],line=(:dash,2), label=\"Forward SIF, excited at $wl_red nm\" )\nplot!(wlf,leaf.Mb[:,ind_wle_red], color=[:orange],line=(:dash,2), label=\"Backward SIF, excited at $wl_red nm\" )\nxlabel!(\"Wavelength (nm)\")\nylabel!(\"Fluorescence\")","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Plot some cross section in wle and wlf space:\nplot(wle,leaf.Mf[ind_wlf_FR,:], color=[:black], lw = 2 , label=\"Forward SIF, emitted at $wl_FarRed nm\")\nplot!(wle,leaf.Mb[ind_wlf_FR,:],color=[:orange], lw = 2 , label=\"Backward SIF, emitted at $wl_FarRed nm\" )\nplot!(wle,leaf.Mf[ind_wlf_R,:], color=[:black],line=(:dash,2), label=\"Forward SIF, emitted at $wl_Red nm\" )\nplot!(wle,leaf.Mb[ind_wlf_R,:], color=[:orange],line=(:dash,2), label=\"Backward SIF, emitted at $wl_Red nm\" )\nxlabel!(\"Absorbed Wavelength (nm)\")\nylabel!(\"Fluorescence\")","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#Leaf-reflectance-and-transmission-1","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Leaf reflectance and transmission","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"Within Fluspect, leaf reflectance and transmission is calculated (this part is actually identical to what PROSPECT is doing and much less involved than the Fluorescence part).
